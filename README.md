# Carrom
## What is Carrom?
Carrom is a tabletop game of Indian origin similar to pool 
but played with flat wooden disks instead. The objective of the game is to sink all the different
colored disks into pockets on the four corners of the board using the striker disk (this is similar to the cue ball in pool). Each different color of disk is worth
a different amount of points: black is worth 10, white is worth 20, and red is worth 50.
